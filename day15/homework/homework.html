    <h1>Hello. Let's talk about music!</h1>
    <p>I love music, and its hard to say "top 3", but i will say my recent or most listened and favorite musicians and
        songs/musics of them that i love</p> <br>
    <h3><u>My favorite Musicians/Artists and their genres: </u></h3>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Lady Gaga</b> - <i>Pop, rock, electronic, Jazz</i> (and more detailed ones). She also sings in style of
            <i>David Bowie</i> and
            <i>Queen</i> into her songs. I love her music and her everything, one of the most unique style,
            talent, performances and shows to die for, prersonality, free & supportive mindset and many others. Also i
            have to mention her amazing music videos that are like mini movies, also her ability to sing & dance and
            make a show (all of them amazingly) on live performances.
        </li>
        <li><b>Korn</b> (band) - <i>Nu-metal, alternative metal</i>. I also love Korn for music and interesting, cool,
            unique members,
            who talk about important problems in lyrics, and are able to make me emotional with lyrics or music. They
            also perform live so well, i want to go to their concert so bad, as on <i>Gaga's</i>.</li>
        <li><b>Nirvana</b> (band) - <i>Grunge, alternative rock</i>, and <b>punk rock</b>. I don't know i mean toooo
            much songs of them, but i like <i>Kurt Cobain's</i> (main
            singer's) mindset, perspective on life and of course, music. I like Nirvana's live performances very much
            also, i would go if <i>Kurt</i> and <i>Nirvana</i> were still alive..</li>
        <li><b>Queen</b> (band) - <i>Rock pop</i> (and more). About them, same as <i>Nirvana</i>, but i LOVE LOVE LOVE
            their multi-genred and one of the most
            talentful music, also members. Especially <i>Freddie Mercury</i>. He was very interesting, talented,
            artistic,
            free person and an amazing showman. <i>Queen</i> live performances? A DREAM. impressive, emotional,
            legendary and
            one of the bests ever.</li>
    </ul><br><br>

    <p>There's so much more, i can't even say these are my top 5, i wouldn't be able to list top 5 Gaga songs alone,
        because at least i have 10 favorite.
        That's all for now.</p>
