    <h1>Hello, this one is about my favorite movies. As always, there's so many, but i can choose my top top ones.</h1>

    <h2><b><i>Saw franchise </i></b></h2>

    <video controls>
        <source src="Saw.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video><br><br>

    <p><b>This is the classic one, it was 10 movies and eleventh one is coming out in 2025.
            The Saw franchise is about twisted games designed by the Jigsaw Killer (John Kramer) to test people's will
            to live through brutal, often deadly traps. It explores themes of morality, survival, and justice. I don't
            know what to say, just watch it and you will want to watch others.
        </b></p><br>

    <h2><b><i>Interstellar</i></b></h2>

    <video controls>
        <source src="Interstellar - Trailer - Official Warner Bros. UK.mp4" type="video/mp4">

    </video><br><br>
    <p><b>Interstellar is about astronauts traveling through a wormhole to find a new habitable planet for humanity,
            exploring themes of love, time, survival, and the relationship between science and emotion. It is so well
            made, an amazing. I wish i could watch it for the fisrt time again, as Saw.
        </b></p><br>

    <h2><b><i>Dead Poets Society</i></b></h2>

    <video controls>
        <source src="DeadPoetsSociety(1989).mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video><br><br>

    <p><b>Dead Poets Society is about an inspiring teacher who encourages students at a conservative boys' school to
            embrace poetry, think freely, and seize the day (carpe diem), challenging societal norms.
            I go to <i>Manana Begiashvili's literary workshop</i>, where she teaches us the same thing: how to think
            freely, be psychologically strong and successful.
            You can search for it on social networks. I'll leave the link:</b></h3>

    <h2><b><i>The Shining</i></b></h2>

        <source src="The Shining - Official Trailer [1980] HD.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video><br>
    <p><b>The Shining is about a writer, Jack Torrance, who becomes the winter caretaker of the haunted Overlook Hotel,
            where he descends into madness, threatening his family. It explores isolation, supernatural forces, and
            psychological horror. I love psychological horrors.
