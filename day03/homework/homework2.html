    <p>FIGURE SKATING</p>
    <p>Figure skating is a sport where skaters perform routines on ice, combining jumps, spins, and footwork. It's known
        for its elegance, as skaters move to music while showing off their skills. There are different types of figure
        skating:</p>

    <p>1. Singles: One skater performs alone, doing jumps, spins, and other moves.</p>
    <p>2. Pairs: Two skaters (a man and a woman) perform together, often lifting each other and doing synchronized
        moves.</p>
    <p>3. Ice Dance: This is more focused on dancing and rhythm, with fewer jumps.</p>

    <p>It's an Olympic sport, and skaters are judged on their technique, creativity, and how well they perform their
        routine.</p>

    <p>For me, this sport is very effective and elegant. Figure skaters work hard to show us performance. Their
        costumes, beautiful moves, make up and enegry is art. <3</p>
