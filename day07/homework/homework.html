        <h6><u><i>WATCH IT!!</i></u></h6>
        <h2>Second example is Malena. I dont know if its exactly considered as a sad movie, <pre>but i think it is one of the saddests ive watched.</pre></h2>
        <p>Maybe, because the problem movie is showing (Harassment of women, their humiliation, violation of rights) is really important, sad and global for me. <br>There still are countries where women are not safe. (nobody's 100% safe ever, but i mean women dont even have rights to talk, go out and etc.) <pre>Its the thing that makes me angry the most.</pre></p>
        <p>Malena is starring Italian actress Monica Bellucci.</p>
