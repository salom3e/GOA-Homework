    <img src="mystt.jpg" alt="mysterious skin"><button>zoom in</button>
    <p>This movie is about two characters, Neil and Brian. They were both abused by their coach when they were kids.
        They are already turning 18. <br>Neil remembers it all and makes money with you know, im not gonna say it.
        Meanwhile Brian cant even think that it had happened and thinks that aliens took him that day when coach did
        horrible things.<br>I will not spoil the ending. Even tho its beautiully made, you cant watch it twice.</p>


    <h4>2. Lilya 4-ever</h4>
    <img src="lilya.webp" alt="lilya forever"><button>zoom in</button>
    <p>This movie is traumatizing and emotional. It shows story of as i remember Russian girl, whos mother left with
        boyfriend. Girl is all alone with no job, money or someone to help. She only has best friend, Volodya. Volodya's
        father is abusive, so he hates his home. They're each others second parts, i would say. Once Lilya met some guy
        at the club. Shortly, he manipulated and lied to her that he had job in other country. Volodya was trying to
        show Lilya reality, but she still belived liar. Lilya was sent to the country and was sold to some terrible man.
        He abused her and ect. Again, i will not spoil the end. This movie changed something in me.</p>

    <h5>3. Basketball Diaries</h5>
    <img src="basktt.jpg" alt="basketball diaries"><button>zoom in</button>
    <p>This one is starring actor Leonardo Dicaprio and is about the main character, who loved basketball and sadly
        became an addict. He had friend group and lived with his mum. As i remember, he was student. The movie is
        beautiful and shows us how hard addiction made life for sweet, goal oriented and interested in sports boy. How
        much problems he got with mother and life in general. Movie includes heavy scenes.</p>
